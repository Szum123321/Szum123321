## Hi! 
My name is Szymon and I do some cool stuff!  
Most of stuff here is related to Minecraft mods, which I began to work on some three years ago. It all started as a fun excersize in java. At that time I mostly did c++. Now I can do both!

Anyway, you're probably here because of them, so enjoy!
